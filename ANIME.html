        <p>Monkey D. Luffy Japanese: モンキー・D・ルフィ also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy is a fictional character and the protagonist of the One Piece manga series, created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits that belonged to "Red Hair" Shanks.

            Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates".

        Devil Fruit: Luffy's rubber attributes are a result of him eating a devil fruit called the Gum-Gum Fruit.[33][34] Granting him a rubber-like body, his powers make him immune to electric attacks and most blunt forces, but he is susceptible to attacks made with a sharp object or weapon (eg. sword, spear). His rubber devil fruit powers grant him the ability to stretch his body at will. He uses his elasticity to accelerate part or all of his body to deliver punches, kicks, head butts, and many other varied attacks as seen throughout the series. Although like others who have eaten a Devil Fruit, Luffy cannot swim; when he is submerged in water or contacts the Sea-Prism Stone, he loses his strength and cannot move on his own. In addition to his Devil Fruit powers, he has immense strength, durability, speed, reflexes, agility, endurance, and stamina.</p>

        <ul type="circle">
            <li>She is proficient in Armament Haki, Observation Haki, and Conqueror's Haki</li>
            <li>Boa Hancock has the Mero Mero no Mi ability, which allows her to petrify her opponents by shooting rays of hearts at them. She can also turn non-living objects to stone. Additionally, she has the Busoshoku Haki, which allows her to create an invisible shield for herself, and the Haoshoku Haki, which is the rarest type of Haki</li>
            <li>Her Mero Mero beam requires the target to have some kind of dirty feelings towards her, and if they don't feel anything towards her, they won't turn to stone</li>

        <P>A native to the North Blue, Sanji grew up as part of the Vinsmoke family under his father Vinsmoke Judge, king of the Germa Kingdom, and mother Vinsmoke Sora.[4] Living under a grueling father who only saw Sanji as a soldier, he escapes to Baratie where he learns to cook under “Red Leg” Zeff[5] and learns his fighting style, which is characterized by the use of legs in combat. Sanji is the fifth member and the fourth to join Monkey D. Luffy’s pirate crew as cook after the battle against Don Krieg</P>
        <HEAD><h4><B>ABILITIES</B></h4></HEAD>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>When fighting, Sanji only ever relies on kicks, never punching opponents because of his belief that a cook's hands are important instruments for their craft, and thus must be protected from harm.</li>
            <li>Sanji utilizes attacks that are variations of kicks (deemed “Black Leg Style”), with the name of the attack usually having something to do with food, such as “Diable Jambe”, wherein he raises the temperatures of his legs so high that they glow bright red.</li>
            <li>During the timeskip, he develops Observation Haki, which allows him to sense the intent and presence of others, such as when he was able to dodge a jelly bean bullet from Katakuri. He is also able to utilize Armament Haki, which allows him to harden parts of his body and be able to attack Logia users.</li>

        <p>Usopp is the son of Yasopp and Banchina and was born and raised in Syrup Village, serving as "captain" of the Usopp Pirates and being Kaya's close friend. After working with the Straw Hats to defeat Kuro and the Black Cat Pirates, he was invited to join the crew</p>
        <head><h4><b>ABILITIES</b></h4></head>
        <UL TYPE="DISC">
            <LI>Usopp is an extremely skilled sniper. Since early in the series, he was shown to have inherited much of his father Yasopp's exceptional marksman skills.</LI>
            <li>His marksmanship is nearly unmatched, accurately hitting Spandam and some Marines from a vast distance of over a mile out-distancing even the guns the Marines had with the wind against him. In order to stop Sugar a second time, he demonstrated his ability to calculate and predict trajectory angles, influence of wind and distance, and even incorporating booster shots into his projectile, thereby allowing him to hit his target located indoors, physically located too far away to even be visualized, through a small opening in a window.</li>
